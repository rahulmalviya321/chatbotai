This code defines a simple chatbot web application using Streamlit and the Google GenerativeAI (Gemini API). Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. **User Interface Setup**: It creates a Streamlit app with a title ("Simple Chatbot"), a text input for users to type their messages, and a "Send" button to submit messages.

2. **Chat History Display**: It includes a placeholder to display the chat history, which will show both user messages and the chatbot's responses.

3. **GenerativeAI Integration**: It configures and uses the GenerativeAI API (specifically, the Gemini-Pro model) to generate responses based on user input.

4. **Message Submission Handling**: When the user clicks the "Send" button, the code calls the `display_chat_history()` function to generate a response using the Gemini API and updates the chat history with the user's message and the chatbot's response.

Overall, this code creates a basic chatbot interface where users can interact by typing messages, and the chatbot responds using the GenerativeAI model.
